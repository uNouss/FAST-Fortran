"
I represent Fortran Logical statement. The logical data type, LOGICAL, holds a logical value .TRUE. or .FALSE. The value 0 represents .FALSE.; any other value represents .TRUE.The usual default size for an LOGICAL item with no size specified is 4, and is aligned on 4-byte boundaries. However, these defaults can be changed by compiling with certain special options.
